Most Linux distributions (such as Ubuntu) provide SWI-Prolog as precompiled packages,
i.e. SWI-Prolog and its extra packages (e.g. 'http', 'sgml') can be installed
using the distribution package manager. The following instructs how to install
SWI-Prolog from the sources. Installing from the sources is simple and gives you
better control over which version with which packages is installed.

Assuming that you are in the root directory of the uncompressed SWI tarball
(e.g. pl-5.11.22/), execute the following commands.
Note that /home/myname/Apps/ is the directory where the
bin/, lib/ etc. subdirectories are (or are to be created),
if you want to install under /usr/local/
and have rights to do so, then do not specify the 'prefix' flag.
In this case you probably have to install using sudo (sudo make install).

cd src/
./configure --prefix=/home/myname/Apps/
make
make install
cd ..
cd packages/
env PKG="clib sgml http pldoc" ./configure
make
make install

Note that to run the OWL verbalizer you only need the packages 'clib', 'sgml'.
To run the verbalizer as the HTTP-server you additionally need the package 'http'.
To view the documentation embedded in the source files you need 'pldoc'.
